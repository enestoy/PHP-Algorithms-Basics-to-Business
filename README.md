# PHP Algorithms: Basics to Business

## ðŸ“Œ About the Project

This repository is designed for those who want to learn the basic principles of algorithms and see how they can be implemented using PHP. We aim to explain algorithm logic both theoretically and practically, adhering to clean code principles and making it easy to understand.

## ðŸŽ¯ Our Goals

- **Explain algorithms in a simple and understandable way**  
- **Develop applications in PHP following clean code principles**  
- **Teach important algorithms used in the business world**  
- **Reach a wide audience with both Turkish and English resources**  

## ðŸ“‚ Content

Each algorithm in this repo is covered with four files:  
âœ… **Turkish Markdown (.md):** Explains the core concepts of the algorithm.  
âœ… **English Markdown (.md):** Provides explanation for a global audience in English.  
âœ… **Turkish PHP File (.php):** PHP implementation of the algorithm.  
âœ… **English PHP File (.php):** PHP code example according to the English documentation.
