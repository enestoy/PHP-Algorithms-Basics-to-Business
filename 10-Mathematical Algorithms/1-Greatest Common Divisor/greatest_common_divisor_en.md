# Euclidean Algorithm for Computing the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)

## What is GCD?

GCD stands for **Greatest Common Divisor**. It is the largest number that divides two numbers without leaving a remainder. For example, the GCD of 36 and 60 is 12 because 12 is the largest number that divides both 36 and 60.

## What is the Euclidean Algorithm?

The Euclidean Algorithm is a mathematical method used to compute the GCD efficiently. This algorithm relies on division. It finds the GCD of two numbers by repeatedly dividing one number by the other, calculating the remainder, and using this remainder to continue the process until the GCD is found.

## Steps of the Euclidean Algorithm

1. **Take Two Numbers:** Two positive integers \( a \) and \( b \) are given (for example, 36 and 60).
2. **Perform the Division:** In the first step, divide \( a \) by \( b \).
3. **Calculate the Remainder:** Find the remainder of the division.
4. **Continue Using the Remainder:** In the next step, replace \( b \) with the remainder and repeat step 2 until the remainder is 0.
5. **Result:** When the remainder is zero, the divisor at that step is the GCD.

### Example

Let's calculate the GCD of 36 and 60:

1. First, divide 60 by 36:
   \[
   60 \div 36 = 1 \quad \text{(Quotient: 1, Remainder: 24)}
   \]
   The remainder is 24.

2. Now, divide 36 by 24:
   \[
   36 \div 24 = 1 \quad \text{(Quotient: 1, Remainder: 12)}
   \]
   The remainder is 12.

3. Then, divide 24 by 12:
   \[
   24 \div 12 = 2 \quad \text{(Quotient: 2, Remainder: 0)}
   \]
   The remainder is 0.

4. When the remainder is 0, the last divisor, 12, is the GCD.

**Result:** The GCD of 36 and 60 is **12**.
