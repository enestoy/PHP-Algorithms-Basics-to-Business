# Fast Exponentiation Algorithm

## What is Exponentiation?

Exponentiation is the operation of multiplying a number by itself a specific number of times. For example, the expression \(a^b\) means multiplying \(a\) by itself \(b\) times. Mathematically:
\[
a^b = a \times a \times a \times \ldots \quad (\text{b times})
\]
This operation can be time-consuming, especially for large exponents. **Fast Exponentiation** is a technique used to perform such calculations more quickly.

## What is Fast Exponentiation?

**Fast Exponentiation** is an algorithm that makes exponentiation faster by using the **divide and conquer** method. Instead of performing repeated multiplication, the algorithm breaks down the exponentiation into smaller parts, making the calculations much faster.

### Key Principles

- If the exponent is even, we divide the problem in half.
- If the exponent is odd, we reduce the exponent by one and then square the result.

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Even Exponent Case:**
   If the exponent **b** is even, then \(a^b\) can be written as:
   \[
   a^b = (a^{b/2})^2
   \]
   That is, we halve the exponent and square the result.

2. **Odd Exponent Case:**
   If the exponent **b** is odd, then:
   \[
   a^b = a \times a^{b-1}
   \]
   That is, we reduce the exponent by one and square the result again.

### How Does the Fast Exponentiation Algorithm Work?

To compute \( a^b \):

1. Start with \( a \) and \( b \).
2. If **b** is zero, the result is 1 because any number raised to the power of zero is 1.
3. If **b** is odd, multiply \( a \) once and continue the process to calculate \( a^{b-1} \).
4. If **b** is even, square \( a \) and halve the exponent.

### Example

Let's compute \( a = 2 \) and \( b = 13 \) using the fast exponentiation algorithm:

1. \( 2^{13} \) is odd, so we write it as \( 2 \times 2^{12} \).
2. \( 2^{12} \) is even, so we write it as \( (2^6)^2 \).
3. \( 2^6 \) is even, so we write it as \( (2^3)^2 \).
4. \( 2^3 \) is odd, so we write it as \( 2 \times 2^2 \).
5. \( 2^2 \) is even, so we write it as \( (2^1)^2 \).
6. \( 2^1 \) is odd, so we write it as \( 2 \times 2^0 \).
7. \( 2^0 = 1 \).

As a result, after all these steps, \( 2^{13} = 8192 \).

## Advantages of Fast Exponentiation

- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity of the Fast Exponentiation algorithm is **O(log b)**, which is very fast because the exponent is halved at each step.
- **Efficiency:** It is much more efficient for calculating large exponents compared to traditional multiplication methods.

## Applications

- **Cryptography:** Operations involving large exponents, such as RSA encryption, are sped up using this algorithm.
- **Numerical Computations:** Used for high-precision exponentiation in physical simulations and engineering calculations.
- **Algorithms:** Fast exponentiation is required in various algorithms, especially when dealing with problems involving large numbers.
