# K-Means Clustering Algorithm

## What is K-Means Clustering?

K-Means Clustering is a clustering algorithm used to partition data into a specified number of clusters. The data is grouped in such a way that it is closest to the predetermined number of cluster centers (centroids).

## Working Principle of K-Means Algorithm

1. **Initialization of Centroids:** The number of clusters (k) is specified by the user, and k random cluster centers are chosen.
2. **Assigning Data Points to Cluster Centers:** Each data point is assigned to the nearest cluster center.
3. **Calculating New Cluster Centers:** The average of each cluster's data points is calculated to find the new cluster center.
4. **Repetition:** The process of assigning data points to new cluster centers and updating the centroids continues until the cluster centers stabilize or a predefined number of iterations is reached.

## Advantages of the K-Means Algorithm

- Simple and fast.
- Effective for large datasets.
- Can give good results when the number of clusters is predetermined.

## Disadvantages of the K-Means Algorithm

- The number of clusters (k) needs to be defined beforehand.
- The initialization of centroids can lead to different results.
- May not work well for non-globular clusters.

## Applications of K-Means

- Customer segmentation
- Image compression
- Anomaly detection
- Recommendation systems

The K-Means algorithm is an effective method frequently used to partition large and meaningful datasets.
