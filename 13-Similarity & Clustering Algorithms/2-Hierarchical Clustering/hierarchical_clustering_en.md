# Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm

## What is Hierarchical Clustering?

Hierarchical Clustering is a clustering algorithm that groups data points into a hierarchical structure. This method forms clusters by organizing data into a nested tree structure (dendrogram).

## Working Principle of Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm

Hierarchical clustering has two main approaches:

### 1. **Bottom-Up (Agglomerative) Approach**

- Each data point is initially considered as its own cluster.
- The two closest clusters are merged to create a new cluster.
- This process continues until only one cluster remains.

### 2. **Top-Down (Divisive) Approach**

- All data points start as a single cluster.
- The cluster is split into sub-clusters based on the most dissimilar data points.
- This process continues until each data point becomes its own cluster.

## Advantages of the Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm

- The number of clusters does not need to be determined beforehand.
- Clustering results can be visualized using a dendrogram.
- The clustering structure can be analyzed at different levels.

## Disadvantages of the Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm

- High computational cost for large datasets.
- Difficult to revert if clustering is incorrect.
- Sensitive to the distance measurement between data points.

## Applications of Hierarchical Clustering

- Genetic analysis
- Customer segmentation
- Document clustering
- Image processing

The Hierarchical Clustering algorithm is an effective method, especially for visualizing the clustering structure and analyzing data groups at different levels.
