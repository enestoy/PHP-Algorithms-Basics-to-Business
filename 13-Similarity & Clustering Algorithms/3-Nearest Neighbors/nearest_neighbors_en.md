# Nearest Neighbors Algorithm

## What is Nearest Neighbors?

Nearest Neighbors is an algorithm that performs classification and clustering by measuring the similarity between data points. The most well-known version is **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, which **determines the class of a data point based on the classes of its nearest neighbors.**

## Working Principle of Nearest Neighbors Algorithm

1. **Distance Measurement:** The distance between a new data point and other points in the dataset is calculated. Typically, Euclidean distance is used.
2. **Selecting Nearest Neighbors:** The **k** nearest neighbors are selected.
3. **Determining the Result:**
   - **Classification:** The majority class of the neighbors is assigned as the class of the new data point.
   - **Regression:** The average of the neighbors is used to make a prediction.

## Advantages of the Nearest Neighbors Algorithm

- Easy to understand and implement.
- Does not require a training phase, decisions can be made instantly.
- Works effectively with small and medium-sized datasets.

## Disadvantages of the Nearest Neighbors Algorithm

- High computational cost for large datasets.
- Sensitive to noisy data.
- Accuracy can decrease if the value of **k** is chosen incorrectly.

## Applications of Nearest Neighbors

- Recommendation systems
- Fraud detection
- Medical diagnosis
- Image recognition

The Nearest Neighbors algorithm is a widely used method for grouping similar data points and correctly classifying new incoming data.
