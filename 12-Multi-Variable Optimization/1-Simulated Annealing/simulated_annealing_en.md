# Simulated Annealing Algorithm

Simulated Annealing (SA) is a global search algorithm used for multivariable optimization problems. It is based on the physical annealing process and aims to reach the global optimum.

## Key Concepts

- **Annealing**: In physics, annealing refers to the process of melting a material at a high temperature and then slowly cooling it down. During this process, the material transitions from a disordered state to an ordered one (i.e., the minimum energy state). The SA algorithm simulates this process through a mathematical model.

- **State Transition**: In the SA algorithm, each solution is considered a "state." The algorithm transitions from one state to another in the solution space. The energy of this transition is determined by the quality of the solution.

- **Temperature**: Temperature controls the algorithm's "openness" to new states in the solution space. At high temperatures, the algorithm is also open to worse solutions, which provides a broader search space.

## Algorithm Steps

1. **Initial State**: An initial solution is selected, and a temperature value is determined.
2. **New Solution Generation**: A new solution is generated by making small changes to the current solution.
3. **Acceptance Decision**: If the new solution is better, it is immediately accepted. If it is worse, the worse solution is accepted with a certain probability. This probability depends on the temperature value.
4. **Temperature Update**: The temperature is slowly decreased. As the temperature drops, the probability of accepting worse solutions decreases.
5. **Termination**: When the temperature is low enough, the algorithm stops, and the best found solution is returned.

## Advantages

- Ability to perform global optimization, avoiding getting stuck in local minima.
- Effectively works in complex, multivariable problems.

## Disadvantages

- The search time for a solution depends on the temperature decrease rate. A fast decrease may lead to an early stopping point.
- Parameter settings (initial temperature, temperature decay rate) can affect the success of the algorithm.

## Applications

Simulated Annealing is particularly used in the following areas:

- **Machine Learning**: Model optimization and parameter tuning.
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Finding solutions in high-dimensional search spaces.
- **Industrial Optimization**: Finding the best design and resource allocation in production processes.
